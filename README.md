# import_kicad_maya3d


wrote this one afternoon as an experiment to load kicad parts into maya.

I then 3D modeled a part, and sent if back to Kicad through blender.

As I recal, I used blended because my version of maya didnt export the right format that 
Kicad read. I think it was Collada, but I am noit sure.
